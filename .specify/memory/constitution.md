# Ticket System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards

All code MUST maintain high quality through automated tooling and human review. TypeScript strict mode is mandatory with zero `@ts-ignore` usage except with documented justification. ESLint rules MUST be followed with zero warnings in production builds. Code coverage MUST remain above 85% for critical paths. All functions MUST have clear, single responsibilities with descriptive naming. Complex logic requires inline comments explaining the "why" not the "what".

Rationale: Quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation and ensure maintainable, predictable codebase evolution.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY for all business logic and critical user flows. Tests MUST be written before implementation and MUST fail initially. Component tests are required for all React components with both happy path and error scenarios. Integration tests MUST cover API endpoints and database interactions. End-to-end tests are required for complete user workflows. All tests MUST run in under 30 seconds for rapid feedback cycles.

Rationale: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring.

### III. User Experience Consistency

UI components MUST follow a centralized design system with reusable primitives. Loading states are MANDATORY for all async operations exceeding 200ms response time. Error boundaries MUST handle all potential failure states gracefully with user-friendly messages. Forms MUST provide real-time validation with clear error messaging. Navigation patterns MUST be consistent throughout the application. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are NON-NEGOTIABLE requirements.

Rationale: Consistent UX builds user trust, reduces cognitive load, and ensures inclusive access for all users.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Initial page load MUST complete within 2 seconds on 3G networks. Core Web Vitals MUST meet Google's "Good" thresholds: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. Bundle size increases require explicit justification and performance impact analysis. Images MUST be optimized and served in modern formats (WebP/AVIF). Database queries MUST be optimized with proper indexing and connection pooling. Memory leaks are prohibited - all subscriptions and event listeners MUST be properly cleaned up.

Rationale: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, SEO rankings, and business conversion rates.

### V. Type Safety & Error Handling

All data boundaries (API responses, user inputs, external integrations) MUST be validated using Zod schemas. Runtime type guards are required for dynamic content. Error handling MUST be explicit with proper error types and structured logging. API errors MUST be categorized (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors) with appropriate user feedback. Global error boundaries MUST capture and report unexpected failures. Null/undefined checks are mandatory for all optional properties.

Rationale: Type safety prevents runtime errors, improves developer experience, and enables confident refactoring.

### VI. Functional Programming & Modern React Patterns (MANDATORY)

ALL components MUST be functional components using React Hooks - class-based components are PROHIBITED. Custom hooks MUST be used for all reusable stateful logic and side effects. Service layer MUST follow functional programming principles with pure functions and immutable data patterns. Business logic MUST be encapsulated in custom hooks (e.g., `useAuth`, `useIssues`, `useComments`) that return consistent interfaces. State management MUST use functional approaches (Zustand stores, React Query) rather than class-based patterns. All async operations MUST be handled through custom hooks with proper loading, error, and success states. Higher-order components (HOCs) are DISCOURAGED in favor of custom hooks and composition patterns. Arrow functions MUST be prioritized over traditional function declarations for consistency, conciseness, and lexical scoping benefits - use `const functionName = () => {}` instead of `function functionName() {}`.

Rationale: Functional patterns improve testability, enable better code reuse, align with modern React best practices, reduce complexity through composition over inheritance, and arrow functions provide consistent lexical scoping and more predictable behavior.

## Performance Standards

React components MUST implement proper memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) for expensive operations. State updates MUST be batched to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Virtual scrolling is required for lists exceeding 100 items. Code splitting MUST be implemented at route level with proper loading fallbacks. Third-party dependencies MUST be evaluated for bundle size impact before adoption. Database connection pools MUST be configured for optimal resource utilization.

## Development Workflow

All features MUST start with a detailed specification in `/specs/` following the spec template. Code reviews are mandatory with at least one approval from a senior developer. Pre-commit hooks MUST enforce linting, formatting, and type checking. Continuous Integration MUST run full test suites with deployment blocking on failures. Feature branches MUST be short-lived (< 3 days) with regular rebasing. Commit messages MUST follow conventional commit format for automated changelog generation.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and coding standards. All pull requests MUST demonstrate compliance with these principles or include explicit justification for deviations. Constitution amendments require team consensus and migration plans for existing code. Complexity additions MUST be justified against the simplicity principle. Regular constitution reviews will be conducted quarterly to ensure relevance and effectiveness.
