# Feature Specification: Issue Tracking Application

**Feature Branch**: `002-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me track issues for a software development. List view and kanban board is a must. This app has a feature of multi step approval ie, Dev -> QA -> PM to approve a bug fix or new feature requests."

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Development team members need to track software issues through their lifecycle from creation to resolution, with different team roles (Developer, QA, Product Manager) participating in a structured approval workflow. Users must be able to view issues in both traditional list format and visual kanban board layout to accommodate different work preferences and team collaboration needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new bug report is submitted, **When** a developer reviews and fixes the issue, **Then** the issue moves to QA approval status and notifies the QA team
2. **Given** an issue is in QA approval status, **When** QA approves the fix, **Then** the issue moves to PM approval status and notifies the Product Manager
3. **Given** an issue is in PM approval status, **When** PM provides final approval, **Then** the issue is marked as resolved and closed
4. **Given** any approval step is rejected, **When** the rejection is submitted with comments, **Then** the issue returns to the previous step with rejection feedback
5. **Given** a user wants to view issues, **When** they access the application, **Then** they can toggle between list view and kanban board view
6. **Given** multiple issues exist, **When** viewing in kanban board, **Then** issues are organized by status columns (New, In Progress, Dev Review, QA Review, PM Review, Resolved)
7. **Given** an authenticated user creates a new issue, **When** they set the priority level, **Then** they can choose from High, Medium, or Low priority options
8. **Given** any authenticated user views an issue, **When** they want to assign it, **Then** they can assign it to any team member regardless of their own role

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an approver is unavailable or on leave?
- How does system handle issues that skip approval steps (e.g., critical hotfixes)?
- What occurs when an issue is reopened after being resolved?
- How are approval notifications handled for team members?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-004**: System MUST allow authorized users to transition issues between workflow states
- **FR-005**: System MUST track approval history and comments for each workflow step
- **FR-006**: System MUST support issue assignment to specific team members
- **FR-007**: System MUST categorize issues by type (bug fix, new feature request)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow rejection at any approval step with mandatory feedback
- **FR-009**: System MUST notify relevant team members when issues require their attention
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist issue data and workflow state
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to filter and search issues by status, assignee, type, and priority
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent unauthorized workflow transitions based on user roles
- **FR-013**: System MUST display issue age and time spent in each workflow step
- **FR-014**: System MUST support issue comments and discussion threads
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow bulk operations on multiple issues in list view
- **FR-016**: System MUST authenticate users through Supabase with role-based access control

- **FR-018**: System MUST allow any authenticated user to create and assign issues
- **FR-019**: System MUST deliver notifications through in-app messaging system

### Key Entities
- **Issue**: Represents a bug fix or feature request with title, description, type, priority (High/Medium/Low), status, assignee, creation date, and approval history
- **User**: Represents team members authenticated via Supabase with roles (Developer, QA, Product Manager) and permissions for workflow actions
- **Workflow Step**: Represents each stage in the approval process with status, approver, timestamp, and comments
- **Comment**: Represents discussion entries linked to specific issues with author, timestamp, and content
- **Notification**: Represents in-app alerts sent to users when issues require their attention or action
