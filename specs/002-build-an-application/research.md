# Research: Issue Tracking Application

**Feature**: Issue Tracking Application  
**Date**: 2025-09-25  
**Research Phase**: Phase 0

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.7 for fast development and optimized production builds
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state (user, notifications) + TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router (to be added) for SPA navigation
- **UI Framework**: Custom components with potential Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend & Database
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase for authentication, real-time subscriptions, and PostgreSQL database
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with row-level security (RLS) policies
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates on issue status changes

### Data Validation & Forms
- **Schema Validation**: Zod for runtime type validation
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod resolvers
- **API Validation**: Zod schemas for all API boundaries

### UI/UX Libraries
- **Notifications**: Sonner for toast notifications
- **Error Handling**: React Error Boundary for graceful error recovery
- **Icons**: Lucide React or similar icon library (to be added)
- **Drag & Drop**: React DnD or @dnd-kit for kanban board functionality (to be added)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest (to be configured) for utility functions
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library with Vitest
- **Integration Testing**: API testing with Supabase client
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright or Cypress (to be configured)

### Development Tools
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins
- **Formatting**: Prettier (to be configured)
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode
- **Pre-commit**: Husky + lint-staged (to be configured)

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Organize components as atoms, molecules, organisms
- **Feature-based Folders**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract reusable logic (useIssues, useAuth, useNotifications)

### State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data, caching, and synchronization
- **Client State**: Zustand stores for authentication, UI state, and notifications
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for form management and validation

### Database Schema Design
- **Users Table**: Supabase auth.users extended with roles and profile data
- **Issues Table**: Core issue data with relationships to users and workflow steps
- **Workflow Steps**: Track approval history and comments
- **Comments Table**: Discussion threads linked to issues
- **Notifications Table**: In-app notification system

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Real-time Updates
- **Challenge**: Keeping kanban board and list views synchronized across users
- **Solution**: Supabase real-time subscriptions with optimistic updates

### 2. Role-based Permissions
- **Challenge**: Enforcing workflow transitions based on user roles
- **Solution**: Supabase RLS policies + client-side validation

### 3. Performance with Large Lists
- **Challenge**: Rendering hundreds of issues efficiently
- **Solution**: Virtual scrolling, pagination, and React optimization techniques

### 4. Kanban Board Interactions
- **Challenge**: Smooth drag-and-drop with real-time updates
- **Solution**: Optimistic updates with conflict resolution

## Dependencies to Add
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-router-dom": "^6.15.0",
    "@dnd-kit/core": "^6.0.0",
    "@dnd-kit/sortable": "^7.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.0",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "^0.34.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.0.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.0",
    "husky": "^8.0.0",
    "lint-staged": "^14.0.0",
    "playwright": "^1.37.0"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Supabase handles secure authentication flows
- **Authorization**: Row-level security policies for data access
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas prevent malicious input
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection + content sanitization

## Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading
- **React Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for expensive operations
- **Bundle Analysis**: Vite bundle analyzer for size monitoring
- **Image Optimization**: Modern formats (WebP/AVIF) for any user-uploaded content

## Deployment Strategy
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify for static site deployment
- **Database**: Supabase managed PostgreSQL
- **Environment**: Separate staging and production environments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## RESOLVED: No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain
All technical unknowns have been resolved through package.json analysis and feature requirements.
