# Test Setup Complete ✅

## What was configured:

### 1. Testing Dependencies
- **Vitest**: Modern testing framework for Vite projects
- **@testing-library/react**: React component testing utilities
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Custom Jest matchers for DOM elements
- **@testing-library/user-event**: User interaction simulation
- **jsdom**: DOM environment for testing

### 2. Configuration Files
- **vite.config.ts**: Added Vitest configuration with globals, jsdom environment, and setup file
- **src/test/setup.ts**: Test setup file importing jest-dom matchers
- **package.json**: Added test scripts (`test` for watch mode, `test:run` for CI)

### 3. Example Test
- **src/App.test.tsx**: Basic component test to verify setup works

### 4. CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Uncommented test execution in CI pipeline
- Tests now run automatically on push/PR to main and develop branches

## Available Commands:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode (development)
npm test

# Run tests once (CI/CD mode)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Next Steps:

Following the TDD approach defined in the constitution, you can now:

1. **Write Tests First**: Create test files alongside your components
2. **Follow the 88 Tasks**: Each task in `tasks.md` includes test requirements
3. **Maintain Coverage**: Aim for 85% coverage as specified in constitution
4. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle for all new features

## File Structure:
```
src/
├── test/
│   └── setup.ts          # Test configuration
├── App.test.tsx          # Example test
└── [component].test.tsx  # Future component tests
```

Your test setup is now complete and ready for development!
